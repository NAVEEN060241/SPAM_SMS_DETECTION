# 📟 Spam SMS Detection
# Introduction

This project is all about detecting spam SMS (text messages) using a machine learning model. The goal is to separate the 🚫 spam from the 📬 legitimate (ham) SMS messages. It's an exciting starting point for learning about machine learning and natural language processing. 🎉

# Getting Started

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:

Python (3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook (optional but helpful)
Required Python packages: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Project Files
spam_sms_detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for the project.
data.csv: A dataset containing SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. 📊

# Usage
Open the spam_sms_detection.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the step-by-step instructions to understand the project, including data preparation, model building, and evaluation. 🚀
Data
We use the provided data.csv file for training and testing the model. This dataset contains SMS messages with labels indicating whether they are spam or ham. 📁

# Model
We use a basic machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The model uses techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction and a simple classification algorithm. 🤖

# Evaluation
We assess the model's performance using basic metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices. The notebook explains how to interpret these results. 📈
